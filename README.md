# Ai-Based-Disease-Diagnosis-from-Symptoms
This ai based diases diagnosis project addresses the challenge of identifying common health conditions based on a patient's symptoms implementing decision tree, random forest and support vector machine algorithms.
Problem Description 
Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare by providing decision-support systems that assist in early diagnosis. This project addresses the challenge of identifying common health conditions based on a patient's symptoms. In a real-world clinical scenario, patients often present with overlapping symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue, making manual diagnosis time-consuming for medical staff. A significant technical challenge in this domain is the non-linear relationship between symptoms; for example, a fever might indicate multiple conditions, but its coexistence with specific indicators like nausea or fatigue requires complex decision boundaries that traditional rule-based systems may fail to capture.
The goal is to develop a machine learning classification model that analyzes physiological data—including Age, Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Headache, and Nausea—to predict one of five possible conditions: Covid-19, Flu, Allergy, Common Cold, or Gastroenteritis. By utilizing algorithms like Random Forest and Decision Trees, the system can identify complex patterns in symptom combinations that might be missed by human observation alone, providing a foundational prototype for automated triage in modern healthcare.  The model aims to integrate heterogeneous data types, combining numerical demographic information with binary clinical symptoms to provide a holistic diagnostic suggestion.
Model Generalization:
•	Training Accuracy: 98.96%
•	Testing Accuracy: 95.83% 
The small gap between these scores confirms that the model is Well-Generalized, meaning it can accurately diagnose new patients without overfitting the training data. To ensure the model was not overfitting, we compare the Training Accuracy and Testing Accuracy. Since both scores were consistently high (above 90%) and the gap between them was minimal, we can say that the model achieved high generalization capability. It successfully learned the underlying medical patterns instead of merely memorizing the training samples.
